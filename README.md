# Cloud Foundry buildpack: .NET Core

[![CF Slack](https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.slack.com) Join us on Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/buildpacks/)

A Cloud Foundry buildpack for .NET Core applications.

For more information about ASP.NET Core see:

* [ASP.NET Github](https://github.com/aspnet/home)
* [Introduction to ASP.NET Core](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/conceptual-overview/aspnet.html)

## Usage

```bash
cf push my_app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dotnet-core-buildpack.git
```

## Buildpack User Documentation

Official buildpack documentation can be found at <http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/dotnet-core/index.html>.

## Building the Buildpack

These steps only apply to admins who wish to install the buildpack into their Cloud Foundry deployment. They are meant to be run in a Linux shell and assume that git, Ruby, and the bundler gem are already installed.

1. Make sure you have fetched submodules

  ```bash
  git submodule update --init
  ```

1. Get latest buildpack dependencies

  ```bash
  BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle
  ```

1. Build the binary dependencies (optional)

  If you need to rebuild these, to change a version for example, see the included Dockerfiles. They contain comments specifying the commands to run. Then update manifest.yml to point to your files.

1. Build the buildpack

  `uncached` means the buildpack's binary dependencies will be downloaded the first time an application is staged, and `cached` means they will be packaged in the buildpack ZIP.

  ```bash
  BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle exec buildpack-packager [ --uncached | --cached ]
  ```

1. Use in Cloud Foundry

  Upload the buildpack to your Cloud Foundry and optionally specify it by name

  ```bash
  cf create-buildpack custom_dotnet-core_buildpack dotnet-core_buildpack-cached-custom.zip 1
  cf push my_app -b custom_dotnet-core_buildpack
  ```

## Unit Testing

Having performed the steps from Building:

```shell
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle exec rake spec
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests are run using [Machete](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/machete).

To run all the tests (unit and integration):

```bash
CF_PASSWORD=admin BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle exec buildpack-build --host=local.pcfdev.io
```
